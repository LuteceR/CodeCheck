One hot summer day, Petya and his friend Vasya decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and ripest one, in their opinion. After a short weighing procedure, the scales showed w kilograms. Having hurried home, exhausted from thirst, the guys began to divide the purchased berry, but they faced a difficult task. Petya and Vasya are big fans of even numbers, so they want to divide the watermelon so that each person's share weighs exactly an even number of kilograms, while the shares do not necessarily have to be equal in size. The guys are very tired and want to start eating as soon as possible, so you should tell them whether they will be able to divide the watermelon, taking into account their wishes. Of course, everyone should get a piece of positive weight.
